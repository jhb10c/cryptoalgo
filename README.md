# cryptoalgo
This Repo contains implementations of (non-production) cryptographic schemes and primitives. There are two types of files: python files with the functions and jupyternotebooks. 

Here is a mybinder link to the implementation of the Miller-Rabin Test: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jhb10c/cryptoalgo/main?filepath=PrimeNumberGenerator%2FMRPrime.ipynb)

The prime number generator can generate primes up to 32 bits length in under a minute.
